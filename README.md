# Polynomial-Regression-with-Scikit-learn

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).

In this notebook, i used scikit-learn library to solve this problem.

I used some graphical representations to viualize our results.
